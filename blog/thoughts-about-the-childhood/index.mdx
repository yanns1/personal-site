description: Some of my recent thoughts.

I write this post to emphasize one thing I which I knew and integrated: humans are messy and flawed.

That's a pretty pessimistic claim, but as live goes on and experiences (good and bad ones) come in and out, I realize that nothing is perfect.

Each idea, value, ideal can become irrelevant at any moment.

All human has its qualities and flaws, and these may be different at each moment.

For example, if you're grandmother used to be kind with you the last ten years of your life, it doesn't prevent that she may will, because of whatever reasons, criticize you negatively for a stupid thing.

We're used to classify others by the roles they play in our lives, by the contexts in which we interact with them, by the behaviors we expect from them...

With time, our brains identify patterns. That's the case regarding the behaviors of others.

That's useful for many things. But one for which that can be problematic is when someone "changes".

Remember, a person can behave in any possible way at any given moment.

And when we're used to a certain pattern, a certain behavior from someone, we might be unready for the change when it comes and react badly.

Well, these thoughts come from experience and putting things into perspective.

But when you're a child (anyway that was my case), you clearly don't have that experience, nor you care.

When adults yell at you:

> Listen to me. I've more experience than you blablabla...

Your child brain thinks:

> What the heck is he talking about ? He's just wrong !

In fact, that's how I wish I thought more often back then. I wish I could be more confident in my ability to reason and keep my position if I had good reasons for.

But what usually happened is that I took really seriously whatever an "adult" would say to me.

So first, I followed what they said (which is not a big deal if I can correct myself later in cases when they were wrong); but secondly I put way too much confidence in their words, rendering any ability to adapt inexistent.

Then what happens ? You go back to reality, which can be painful.

And that's where the crucial part comes in for me.

It's that when you're a child, because you take things sometimes too seriously or haven't enough experience (and certainly a part of how a young brain reacts and grows himself), you can get easily freaked out emotionally and really, I mean really suffer.

That leads to some kind of "traumas". For me, a trauma refer to some sort of negative experience that "haunt" you, that you think of repeatedly without wanting it nor controlling it. (I'm sure the real meaning of this term is more nuanced but anyway, you now know that this is what I mean behind it.)

So whenever going back to reality is a bit harsh, you loose a large amount of confidence.

Whenever someone criticize you, or worse, an ADULT criticize you, or even worse, an IMPORTANT ADULT (such as your parents, your teacher, the director of your school, your coach of football, your professor of music...) criticize you, that's the end of the world. Literally.

And while you overreact for things that, at the scale of life, just come and go, you do so without realizing it, without having a glimpse of an idea that it's even possible to overreact. Because who told you that you can overreact ?

I bring that on the table because the last few weeks, I woke up and caught me thinking about awkward dreams that are in some ways, based upon difficult experiences I had in my childhood.

And I mean, why now ? That have no sense. I'm at home. I've all my time free because there's no school (COVID 19, quarantine, all that stuff, I'm sure you heard about it). So I can code a LOT which is great ! But why thinking about those difficult moments ?

Finally, to end this train of thoughts, I just wanted to tell you, dear reader, that if you're an adult/ a parent/ a future parent, your acts towards children certainly have bigger impacts than you think.

Maybe try to learn to your kids to take things less seriously because, like Heraclitus said:

> The only constant in life is change.

I hope that they can integrate it just by us telling them.

But it may be an unrealistic hope because again, borrowing a quote from a tweet of James Clear:

> History repeats itself because some experiences need to be lived before they can be understood.

The first time I read this quote, I said to myself:

> Oh good ! That's so true !

But at the same time it makes me sad because that means that, in a certain extent, every human being will fail at the same challenges in order to learn, whereas its ancestors have done the same mistakes and came up with (certainly) great solutions.

That's just a waste of time and energy ! (setting aside the possible pain and suffering)

But I guess, that's how life is.

Would life be worse living if there was no challenges ?

Would life be fun if we already knew all the things ahead of time ?

Would happiness exist if there was no suffering ?

Probably not.

That's where this post ends. I hope some of those words speak to you and trigger some interesting reflections in your mind.

On that, have a good day !
