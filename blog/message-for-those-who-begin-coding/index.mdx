## Introduction

I've been programming for almost one year and half now (since March 2019) and amazed by the progress I've made, but also by the landscape of learning that grows endlessly beyond me.

Programming, I think, is not an easy thing to learn for the majority of people.

I don't really know where to put myself on the spectrum, but I think I was pretty lucky to have the will and the interest to persist.

So in this post, I will talk about the difficulties I faced and how I overcame them.

I hope it will give hope for those who begin coding and prepare them to potential barriers they may face.

Thus, that should reduce the chances of giving up.

## How to know if you love programming ?

The approach I had when I started programming (and I've this approach with any kind of new activity I start to learn) was to force me to code 1/2h each day during a month.

Only then I would make a recap and decide to continue or not based on my feelings.

Why ?

Because otherwise, one day that I get particularly de-motivated or upset, I could decide to stop programming forever.

And that's a shame to abandon a potential source of joy in your life, as well as accumulated knowledge and experience that may be really useful in the future, just because of a decision biaised by your mood in the moment.

At the end of the month, you will have a real time dedicated to taking perspective on your experience and feelings, thus making a decision less biaised and more likely to reflect your real desires.

If you find that you don't like programming after this month, just stop.

There's no reason to continue.

Don't feel guilty because you judge that you give up.

That's not abandoning. That's a conscious choice.

And by the way, that decision is not irreversible.

You can realise some days/weeks later that you actually want to keep coding.

Otherwise, if your motivation go up and down, that sometimes your super excited and other times you feel depressed, not good enough or that some bugs annoy you for multiple hours/days (or even forces you to put aside the thing to keep your mental health), then I would advise you to PERSIST.

That means that there's interest, passion, however you call it.

A challenged passion for sure, but a passion anyway.

Then, you can plan another cycle of 2/3 months this time, determining what you will focus on and AGAIN (that's very important), fixing in advance a moment to recap.

Being in the latter case, that's what I did and I keep making "cycles" to progress.

The gist here is that if you feel to have a real interest in programming, then PERSISTENCE is the most valuable skill you can have.

So spend appropriate resources (time, energy to develop habits and strategies) in order to build that skill.
